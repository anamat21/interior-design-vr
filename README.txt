This project was built on Unity,and according to this website you're able to run VR apps through this simulator: https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-simulate-xrsim/ although I was never able to get it working. When opening the project on Unity, make sure to have the OpenXR plugin on in the Project settings, as well as follow the first few setup steps here: https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-tutorial-hello-vr, except for using Universal 3D core when making the project, instead use Built in renderer. Then, you can connect the VR headset to your laptop and click "Build and run" on Unity to send the project to your headset. Also sending the "final_demo.apk" file should work, since its the completed android app package (all VR application are Android applications).

***UPDATE Unity files are too big for github and canvas, so I think the only way is to add people to Unity's version control. The code in this repository is only a small section of everything needed to run the project.
